# Probabilistic Graphical Models in Python

Base on coursera's PGM (Probabilistic Graphical Models) series by Dr. Daphne Koller, I have migrated some of the exercises to Python. This is due to the difficulty I personally had at following up the course material in Matlab.

These excercises and examples will help the reader implement and use Bayesian Networks from the ground up in Python. Why Python? because I had a more pleasurable experience at debugging and refactoring simple concepts. Debugging also helps at learning about the data without the need to contrive complicated matlab data plots.

Furthermore, you can use this code to make your own inference engine from the groud up and implement it in your AI projects.
